# Game-of-Life

This is my implementation of popular game [Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) created by the British mathematician John Horton Conway.

If you want to play it, all you need to do is copy my repository, install pygame and run game.py.

At the beginning you have to place alive cells by cliking/draging on a grey squares, when you are ready all you have to do is 
press SPACE. If you want to modify your grid or pause the game press SPACE again.

You can customize size and amount of cells in the grid by creating Game class object with diffrent parameters. The Game is written in a class so feel free to import it to your projects.
